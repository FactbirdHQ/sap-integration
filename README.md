# SAP Integration Flow

Disclaimer: the integration flow has been tested ad-hoc against SAP's Sandbox
API as we don't have a SAP license. If you notice any bugs or suggestions for
improvements, feel free to report them here.

This project is a proof of concept and a guidance for customers wanting to
interface SAP to Factbird.

## Use cases

Common use cases include:

- Import products into Factbird

- Import process orders into Factbird

- Manage process order execution from within Factbird (executing and terminating of a process order) ()
